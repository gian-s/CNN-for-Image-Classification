# CNN-for-Image-Classification
TensorFlow Model for Classifying Images.TensorFlow Model created to classify between Cats and Dogs using high Level API Keras. Data Set of 25,000 Cat and Dog images taken from https://www.kaggle.com/

## Training
Install NumPy, MatPlotLib, OpenCV, and the TensorFlow. Download Dataset from Kaggle, and edit the location paths in the Processing_Data.py file. Run the CNN_for_Image_Classification.py to train model. 

## Testing
To view graphical analysis of models use TensorBoard callbacks. See https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard for overview of TensorBoard and logs analysis. 

To test model using any image, use the test.py, and edit the location path for the image
